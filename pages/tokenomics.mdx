## **Tokenomics: A Sustainable Web3 Incentive Engine**

---

*(ERC-20 with Extended Functionality for Node Rewards, Staking, and Buybacks)*

### Core Design Philosophy

---

The $IDSIGN token is designed with three primary objectives:

1. Sustainable value accrual through real utility
2. Balanced incentives for network participants
3. Long-term token price appreciation through systematic buybacks and burns
4. Create a positive feedback loop where network growth drives token value, which in turn attracts more participants and further grows the network.

### **Token Overview**

---

- **Token Standard**: ERC-20 (with ERC-677 compatibility for future oracle integrations).
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 $IDSIGN.
- **Contract**: Tax-modifiable (2% transaction tax), burnable, and ownable.

### **Token Allocation**

---

| Category | % Supply | Vesting Schedule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Node Rewards** | 35% | Linear release over 10 years |
| **Ecosystem & Treasury** | 25% | 2-year cliff, 5-year linear release |
| **Team & Advisors** | 15% | 3-year cliff, 2-year linear release |
| **Investors** | 15% | 1-year cliff, 2-year linear release |
| **Public Sale** | 10% | Unlocked at TGE |

### **Core Token Utilities**

---

1. **Staking for Human Nodes**:
    - To run a Human Node (KYC + certification required), stake **10,000 $IDSIGN** (slashed for malicious acts).
    - Stakers earn fees from:
        - **Escrow commissions** (0.5% of transaction volume).
        - **Mediation fees** (paid by users in $IDSIGN or ETH/USDT, auto-converted to $IDSIGN).
        - **MPCvault access fees** (0.1% per document access).
2. **AI Node Hosting**:
    - Hosting an AI Node requires a **one-time fee of 100 $IDSIGN** (burned).
    - AI Node operators earn **20% of mediation fees** generated by their AI.
3. **Transaction Tax**:
    - **2% tax** on all transfers (excludes staking, escrow, and buybacks).
    - Tax split:
        - 50% to Treasury (buybacks).
        - 50% burned.

### Governance Rights

---

- Voting power proportional to staked tokens
- Minimum 5,000 $IDSIGN required for proposal submission
- Governance decides on:
    - Fee structures
    - Network upgrades
    - Treasury allocations
    - Node requirements

### **Revenue Streams & Buyback Mechanics**

---

- **Escrow Fees**: 0.5% fee on all escrowed transactions (USDT/ETH) → 80% converted to $IDSIGN via automated buybacks.
- **Mediation Fees**: Paid in $IDSIGN (users can opt to pay in ETH/USDT, auto-swapped via Uniswap V3).
- **Buyback-and-Burn**: Treasury uses 50% of tax + 80% of escrow fees to buy $IDSIGN monthly, then burns 50% of bought tokens.

**Tax-Modifiable ERC-20**

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract IDSIGN is ERC20 {
    uint256 public taxRate = 200; // 2% (basis points)
    address public treasury;

    constructor() ERC20("idSign", "IDSIGN") {
        _mint(msg.sender, 1_000_000_000 * 10**18);
        treasury = msg.sender;
    }

    function _transfer(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) internal override {
        uint256 tax = (amount * taxRate) / 10_000;
        super._transfer(sender, treasury, tax);
        super._transfer(sender, recipient, amount - tax);
    }
}

```

**Human Node Staking**

```solidity
// Simplified staking contract (audit required)
contract HumanNodeStaking {
    mapping(address => uint256) public stakedTokens;
    uint256 public constant MIN_STAKE = 10_000 * 10**18;

    function stake(uint256 amount) external {
        require(amount >= MIN_STAKE, "Insufficient stake");
        IERC20(IDSIGN).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        stakedTokens[msg.sender] += amount;
    }
}

```

### **Launch Strategy**

---

1. **Phase 1 (Seed Round)**:
    - Private sale (5% supply) at $0.005/token.
    - DEX liquidity: 5% supply + 500 ETH paired on Uniswap V3.
2. **Phase 2 (Public Launch)**:
    - Claimable TGE for public sale participants.
    - Enable staking and node registration.
3. **Phase 3 (Ecosystem Growth)**:
    - Integrate escrow buyback bots.
    - Launch AI Node marketplace (Q2 2025).

### Growth Drivers

---

- **Node-Driven Demand**: Human/AI Nodes must acquire $IDSIGN to earn fees, creating buy pressure.
- **Deflationary**: Burn mechanisms (tax, AI Node fees) reduce supply by ~5% annually.
- **Real Utility**: Token is mandatory for accessing network features (staking, dispute resolution).

1. Network Effect

- More nodes → Better service
- Better service → More users
- More users → More fees
- More fees → Higher token value

2. Increasing Utility

- Regular feature additions
- Expanding service offerings
- Integration partnerships
- Growing use cases

3. Reducing Supply

- Systematic burns
- Long-term locks
- Growing stake requirements
- Deflationary mechanics

4. Revenue Sharing

- Direct fee distribution
- Protocol revenue sharing
- Performance incentives
- Compounding rewards

> Our model is inspired from Chainlink’s oracle incentives and Filecoin’s storage proofs, but adds novel mechanics (AI Node burn fees, hybrid tax/buybacks) tailored to idSign’s use cases.
