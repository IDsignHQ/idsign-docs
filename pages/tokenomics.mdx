# Tokenomics Draft 

idSign is a decentralized e-signature & identity protocol revolutionizing digital trust by abstracting signatures into tamper-proof, immutable records on the blockchain, and transforming KYC from a recurring hurdle into a reusable one-time process, addressing the acute needs of governments and large corporations for stringent data privacy.

The $IDSIGN token is central to our ecosystem, offering users enhanced features, subscription upgrades, and cost savings. This document outlines the tokenomics of $IDSIGN, detailing its allocation, utility, and vesting schedules to ensure long-term sustainability and growth.

## **7. Project Roadmap**

Our platform leverages the decentralized nature of blockchain technology to reduce risk, protect privacy, and solidifies authenticity. Storing and sharing the documents in a zero-knowlege and private way is our core focus at idSign. No one, not even us will have access to the files uploaded except the creator and the parties they shared it with. We achieve this using a new technology we developed leveraging MPC technology and Decentralized Key Management to successfully Token Gate access control rules of the files on the MPC blockchain instead of a centralized API like most projects do!

B. TRUE Decentralized Token-Gating using MPC Key Management System

> A New system we are building that leverages Multi-Party Computation Blockchain and ZK-SmartContracts to create Access Control Lists on the uploaded files and share access of the encryption key Through the MPC blockchain. Files will be Stored on a Decentralized storage and only be accessible by the owner and parties they share it with. Even idSign employees can Never decrypt user files.

![KYC-start.jpg](../public/KYC-start.jpg)

### Milestone **Alpha v0.1.x ‚úÖ**

- Frontend: Landing Page + Blogs
- DApp: Wallet Login and Magic Email Wallet generation (for onboarding web2 users easily)
- DApp: Dashboard structure
- DApp: Create agreement & Send Signature Requests
- Smart-Contract: DDSP (Decentralized Digital Signature Protocol) for Proof-Of-Signature (On-Chain Dynamic Non-Transferable NFT)
- API: Encrypted Zero-Knowledge Decentralized Document Storage for Agreement PDFs

### **Milestone Alpha v0.2.x üîÅ**

- Smart-Contract: Testing & Auditing D.D.S.P smart-contract
- DApp: Signature Page (Token-Gated Access)
- Proof of Humanity KYC Token
- Full KYC process
- Reusable KYC

### **Milestone Beta v0.3.x üïò**

- Decentralized Escrow Payment Protocol (Proof of Funds Escrowed) for adding a Payment Provider on top of DDSP Agreement
- API: Adding Mediator (Lawyer, Middleman, Inspector) to Validate that the terms of an agreement has been met and release funds
- Pay in StableCoins (USDC, USDT, BUSD, DAI) or BinancePay

### **Future Plans üöÄ**

- A.I. Mediation: We plan to add A.I. integrations to help users create templates, explain agreements and give recommendations on mediation.
- Team Business Plans: We plan to add support for Teams in a web3-native way using multi-sig wallets. This will allow businesses to add their employees to the dashboard and perform actions on their behalf while still insuring security and authorization signatures from multiple Executives in the company before approving any action.
- Smart Agreements: We plan to add support for ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù Agreements that allows users to create functional scripts and flows that will be automatically invoked on-chain. This will improve trust even more and might help eliminate scam projects and protect investors. An example would be for an ICO project to create a SmartAgreement that will launch a private sale then after a specified set time automatically generate the Token, add liquidity and distribute allocations giving the project‚Äôs investors a real trustless experience of the project‚Äôs roadmap!
- Decentralized Escrow Payments
- Web3-native Subscription Plans for Teams (using multi-sig account abstraction smart wallets)
- A.I. Tools and Templates
- Apps and Plugins Integrations Marketplace (Hubspot, Google workspace, Microsoft, etc.)
- Login with idsign SDKs and APIs
