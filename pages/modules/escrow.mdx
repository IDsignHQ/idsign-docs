# Escrow Payments

Escrow is no longer a slow, costly relic. idSign ignites a paradigm shift: smart agreements that execute with machine precision, releasing funds only when conditions breathe life into code. Real-world assets—homes, art, intellectual property—flow freely across borders, governed by unyielding logic, not human whim. This is trust without intermediaries. This is value moving at the speed of innovation.

*Decentralizing Trust in Transactions (e.g., Escrow.com)*

idSign replaces third-party escrow services with self-executing Smart Agreements that automate payments based on predefined conditions.

**Key Features**

- **Smart Agreements**: Dynamic contracts execute code on-chain (e.g., releasing funds upon delivery confirmation).
- **Real-World Asset (RWA) Integration**: Supports tokenized assets (e.g., real estate) with Web3-native escrow solutions.
- **Real-Time Data Triggers**: Agreements respond to external data (IoT sensors, APIs) for context-aware execution.

**Benefits**

- Reduces fraud and delays via tamper-proof automation.
- Lowers transaction fees by eliminating escrow intermediaries.
- Enables scalable, cross-border asset management.

**Market Disruption**

- Displaces traditional escrow services by offering faster, cost-effective, and programmable transaction frameworks.
