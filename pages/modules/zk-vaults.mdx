## Why Decentralized Storage?
**Unmatched Security with Layer 3 MPC:** Our advanced Layer 3 MPC network encrypts your data and splits it into fragments across multiple nodes, making unauthorized access virtually impossible. Only you and your selected wallets can reassemble and decrypt the information, ensuring your privacy is always preserved.

**Zero Trust Architecture:** At idSign, we operate on a zero-trust model. This means that no single party, not even idSign, can access your complete data set. By decentralizing storage and utilizing cutting-edge MPC technology, we eliminate the risk of centralized breaches and unauthorized access, providing you with true data sovereignty.

**Personalized Access Control:** Your data, your rules. With idSign, you can decide exactly who gets access to your information. Share securely with specific wallets, set permissions, and maintain full control over your data’s accessibility at all times.
