# Mediation Network (L2)

*AI-Human Synergy for Dispute Resolution*

A hybrid network where Human Nodes govern AI Agents to mediate disputes, enforce agreements, and authenticate users.
As AI agents transact, negotiate, and resolve conflicts, human oversight becomes the non-negotiable layer of trust. idSign’s Mediation Network ensures every payment, interaction, or decision involving AI agents is governed by KYC-verified Human Nodes—certified experts who validate AI actions, enforce ethical guardrails, and hold ultimate authority. AI agents execute with speed, but humans ensure integrity: approving fund releases, arbitrating disputes, and certifying compliance. This isn’t just oversight—it’s a symbiotic partnership where human judgment elevates AI efficiency, eliminating blind autonomy. For AI to thrive in finance, law, or commerce, it must operate within boundaries defined by people, not just code. At idSign, Human Nodes don’t just mediate—they anchor trust in an AI-driven world, ensuring every transaction is fair, transparent, and unshakably human.

**Key Features**

- **AI-Human Governance**: Human Nodes (KYC-verified experts) oversee AI Agents trained on legal frameworks.

- **AI-Driven Automation**: Agents draft agreements, analyze disputes, and trigger on-chain actions (e.g., refunds).

**Benefits**

- Reduces arbitration costs and time through AI efficiency.
- Enhances trust with unbiased, decentralized governance.
- Monetization: Human Nodes earn fees from escrow, MPCvaults, and AI Agent usage.

**Market Disruption**

- Pioneers a new model for scalable, equitable dispute resolution in decentralized ecosystems.

With the exponential increase in AI adoption, IDSIGN network nodes will become the guardians of AI-generated data through our verified human nodes and their public DID proof-of-certifications. For instance, a lawyer who verifies his credentials and chooses to become a node in our network could mediate on-chain disputes, such as escrow payments or the validity of documents, to ascertain if they are genuine or AI-generated.
