## Abstract

idSign is a pioneering Trustless Signature & Identity Protocol that leverages the power of decentralized blockchain technology, enabling the effortless creation and signing of agreements while providing individuals with the ability to obtain reusable on-chain KYC token.


idSign is a groundbreaking startup offering a decentralized signature protocol and reusable identity protocol. Our solution provides a user experience similar to popular platforms like DocuSign but with the added advantage of decentralization, ensuring enhanced security, privacy, and trust-lessness.

Using our innovative protocol, we mint proof-of-signature wallet-bound tokens, establishing immutable evidence that parties have entered into a legally binding agreement on-chain. This approach eliminates the need for traditional intermediaries and introduces a higher level of transparency and immutability to the signing process.

To ensure the utmost security and privacy, we built a new Module zkShare that stores all documents encrypted on a decentralized storage platform called IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) with keyless MPC Zero-Knowledge encryption. We prioritize user privacy by never storing any of sensitive data and documents uploaded during the Agreement Sending and signing process. Users who complete the KYC process receive a proof-of-humanity token that is wallet-bound and non-transferable. These tokens are dynamic and can change states and levels depending on the progress and completion of their KYC process. With five levels of KYC tokens, users can showcase their identity verification status easily and securely. The KYC documents uploaded also are never stored on a centralized database and are only accessable using zkShare our DKMS module powered by ZK-MPC. 

Furthermore, our Identity SBT offers an additional advantage by allowing users to reuse them on various third-party exchanges or decentralized applications (dApps) that require KYC. By leveraging our tokens, users can avoid redundant KYC processes and enjoy a seamless and efficient onboarding experience across multiple platforms.

In a powerful combination of our signature protocol and KYC features, we enable users to send signature requests specifically to KYCed individuals, further streamlining the signing process and adding an extra layer of trust. This unique integration optimizes efficiency and eliminates potential bottlenecks or delays in the agreement execution process.

idSign is poised to revolutionize the way businesses and individuals handle signatures and identity verification. By leveraging blockchain technology, decentralization, and Zero-Knowledge principles, we provide a secure, private, and efficient solution that meets the growing demands of the modern digital economy.

## The Digital Trust Dilemma 

In a world where data is gold, who hold the keys to their privacy? Trust has become both a paramount concern and a significant bottleneck. Existing eSignature solutions and KYC processes are plagued by inefficiencies, centralized security vulnerabilities, and a lack of transparency, leading to a fragmented and distrustful digital landscape.

Problems:
- **Critical Data Vulnerabilities:** Centralized platforms are ticking time bombs for data breaches, exposing highly sensitive information to catastrophic leaks.
- **System Outage Catastrophes:** A single point of failure could paralyze operations, leaving transactions in limbo and eroding trust irreparably.
- As RWA tokenization gains momentum, centralized platforms are fundamentally ill-equipped. The unique demands of RWAs require flexible, tailored solutions addressing the wave of RWAs demands.
- Privacy Time Bomb in Centralized Platforms: Centralized eSignature platforms store sensitive documents and personal identity information on their servers risking unprecedented privacy violations. Whether through external cyber-attacks or internal malfeasance, the outcome is a profound breach of trust, exposing users to identity theft, financial loss, and irreparable damage to personal and professional reputations.


### Decentralized Signature

1. Lack of Transparency: Traditional signature processes often lack transparency, making it challenging to verify the authenticity and integrity of signed documents. This can lead to disputes and legal complications.
2. Centralized Control: Existing signature platforms are often centralized, relying on a single authority to manage and store signatures. This introduces vulnerabilities and reliance on third-party intermediaries.
3. Lack of Immutable Records: Without a decentralized system, signed documents can be susceptible to tampering or alteration, compromising their legal validity.

### Reusable Decentralized Identity

1. Redundant KYC Processes: Many individuals are required to complete the KYC process multiple times when onboarding onto various platforms or exchanges. This leads to user frustration, delays, and inefficiencies.
2. Data Privacy and Security Risks: Centralized KYC processes require individuals to share sensitive personal information with multiple entities, increasing the risk of data breaches and misuse.
3. Lack of User Control: Individuals have limited control over their KYC information once it is shared with centralized entities. This compromises privacy and increases dependence on intermediaries.

By addressing these problems, idSign offers a decentralized signature protocol that ensures transparency, immutability, and eliminates the need for centralized intermediaries. Additionally, the reusable decentralized KYC feature allows users to securely share their identity information without redundant processes and empowers them with control over their data.
